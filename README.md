# FirstHackathon
> This was my first ever Hackathon. <br>
> The Problem Statment was to create a Single Page Website with the help of HTML, CSS and Javascript only. And the statement that I choose was to create a Landing Page website for a hypothetical college club. <br>
> The one I created is named as "Indian StartUp Foundation". I choose this specific club because there are no such clubs present in our college; and to have one of these will be great for students aspiring to start something of their own !!
